# GaZillion 

GaZillion is an online sanctuary of the world's highest `z-index`es living in the wild.

We came up with a unique formula that enabled us to roughly estimate the "height" of a single "z-unit". Z-index, being a 32bit number, maxes out at 2147483647 which is the biggest 32bit positive number. We took the tallest possible man-made construction (X-Seed 4000) of 4000 meters tall and compared it against the biggest 32bit number. According to our educated guess 536871 "z-units" approximately equal to 1 meter.
